            We will create a simple website to help understand how html based websites work.
            To note: Text written in "/** **/" are for explanation. no need to include it in yours.
          </p>
          <!--Start of example-->
        <xmp>
            <!DOCTYPE html> /** To Declare what kind of page this is**/

            <html> /** the start of your page**/

            <head> /** to tell the website what appears at the tab**/

              <title>Anthony's Library</title> /** what shows at your tab's title**/

            </head>

            <style> /** tells you what style the page has **/

              body {background-color: lightgrey;} /** tells website that the background color of website is black**/

              p {color: black;} /** tells website that font color is lightgrey **/

            </style> /** ends the stlying section of the page **/

            <body> /** beginning of the main content of the page **/

              <h1></h1> /** h means header, goes from 1 to 6, increasing number = small font size **/

            </body> /** end of main content **/

            </html> /** end of page **/

          </xmp>
          <p> That will only create a basic layout, however.
              You should use "css" to spice up your webpage.
          </p>
          <p>  You need to name the file which contains what format you want the webpage
              to ".css". Then, you reference it in &#60;Header&#62; as
              "&#60;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="directory to the file"/&#62;".
          </p>
          <p> this is how it works for the ".css": </p>
          <xmp>

            body /** the category you want to format **/
            {
            	background-color: #000000; /** things you want to change **/
            	font-family: Helvitica, Arial, sans-serif;
            }

            /** you can format for more than 1 category at a time, as long as format are applicable to all  **/
            /** like this:**/
            table, th, td
            {
              border: 10px solid blue;
            } /** opening and closing brackets " { " and " } " **/

          </xmp>
          <p>
            You should always keep an easily ascessible template of your website's general layout,
            so that you can save time in creating webpages.
          </p>
          <p> You can go to w3schools and youtube to furthur learn how to add other stuff in, like adding links, audio and inserting images. </p>

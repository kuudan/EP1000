            <p>General Idea: I would like to make a mood lamp that can display eniviromental readings</p>
            <h5>Specifics:</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>1. It will only react when there is an object within a distance</li>
              <li>2. It will read temperature. If it is too hot, the lamp will turn blue and the display will say that its too hot.</li>
              <li>3. It will read humidity. If it is too humid, the lamp would turn red and ask you to create some ventilation</li>
              <li>4. If there is something too near the lamp, the lamp will turn red and tell you to move away from it.</li>
              <li>5. By default, the lamp will be X(undecided)</li>
              <li>6. If, after a certain period of time, there is no change in response, the lamp will switch its lights off when there is no object in the surroundings/no change in conditions from default (when the light is X, the neutral state for this project)</li>
              <li>7. A button to switch on and off the lights</li>
              <li>8. A potential meter to allow users to adjust conditions in 1., 2., 3.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Who is it intended for:</h5>
              <p>students who use a computer for long periods of time</p>
              <h6>reasons:</h6>
              <ul>
                <li>1. Due to the current pandemic (in 2020), a lot of students have to sit in front of the computer for prolonged periods of time. This lamp will be able to help keep students in check.</li>
                <li>2. When engrossed and/or immersed in their studies, students tend to not take notice of their surroundings -- of which one of them is gluing their eyes to the computer. the lamp will be able to tell the student through the change in color.</li>
                <li>3. Students also tend to play games. Some of these games can overheat the computer. While it is easy to notice how hot the computer has become, sometimes they will ignore it. the lamp can help remind them by telling them that it is too hot.</li>
                <li>4. Comfort is important. Humidity/Temperature affects comfort a lot. The sensors can help inform students that the environment is too humid, which will prompt the to reduce humidty, improving their comfort and hence their ability to learn.</li>
              </ul>
            <h5>Materials needed:</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>1 Push button</li>
                <li>1 small Breadboard</li>
                <li>1 Arduino</li>
                <li>1 LCD display</li>
                <li>1 RGB LED should be needed</li>
                <li>16 male to female wires</li>
                <li>1 potential meter</li>
                <li>1 ultrasonic sensor</li>
                <li>translucent acrylic</li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Designs</h5>
              <img src="..\..\media\fp\idea\idea 1.png"></img>
              <p>This was my first idea, after looking through several mood lamps online.
                As the A part of it is curved, and i intended it to be made of acrylic, i found that it was impossible to do it since I had no time to do it, due to my other projects.
                The B part was to be 3d printed. It has the idea of having a battery source in it, as I thought it would be good for it to be portable. The button, DHT sensor and LCD are at the front of the mood lamp, the LED inside the mood lamp, with some support from below.</p>
              <img src="..\..\media\fp\idea\idea 2.png"></img>
              <p>idea 2. This time, I made it such that the acrylic was all straight, no curved parts and a pattern engraved on it.
                The ultrasonic sensor would be at the top, with the acrylic cover being able to be slot in to Part B, the base of the mood lamp.
                Same as idea 1, the LCD, DHT sensor and button at the front, while the LED is inside the base. There is also support underneath the base.</p>
              <img src="..\..\media\fp\idea\fp_idea.png"></img>
              <p>idea 3. the exterior is the same as idea 2, but this time the insides are elborated on, and instead of making the base round, it is instead sqaure/rectangle to allow more space.
                it is a multi-layer stacking where you gradually add items to each layer, where layer 1 is the bottom of the base, where it fits the arduino and battery.
                 layer 2 fits the bread board, and some screws to secure it and holes for layer 3 to go through. the 3rd layer is made to fit the LED.</p>
              <img src="..\..\media\fp\3d\v0.png"></img>
              <p>So at first, i tried to make the base out of laser cut, but i forgotten that i needed to make parts to secure the arduino board, breadboard and other devices, so i scrapped this model.</p>
              <img src="..\..\media\fp\3d\layer 2 v1.png"></img>
              <p> following my third idea, i tried to make a 2nd layer, but this kind of design is bound to fail as it has very little supports after I discussed with others about this.</p>
              <img src="..\..\media\fp\3d\v0.png"></img>
              <p>this is the base idea (finalized) for the model, without any securing for the LCD and Arduino Board. After that, i made a new save on a new model. (wow, i went 57 versions into this model)</p>
              <img src="..\..\media\fp\3d\layer 2 v2 top.png"></img>
              <img src="..\..\media\fp\3d\layer 2 v2 side.png"></img>
              <p>This is my finalized base model for the 2nd layer, after realizing what i can do to improve the model. I added in the hole in the base model of the base to accomodate for it.</p>
              <p>After that, i worked on the laser cut parts to contain the ultrasonic sensor, DHT sensor and the main part of the mood lamp --- the translucent acrylic cover.</p>
              <img src="..\..\media\fp\3d\USS.png"></img>
              <img src="..\..\media\fp\3d\dht.png"></img>
              <img src="..\..\media\fp\3d\led v1.png"></img>
              <p> because i was experimenting with the parameters, i came up with a really messed up model to contain the rgb led, with 100 slots or so.</p>
              <p> as such, i redid my model several days later, where i made a better version of the model.</p>
              <img src="..\..\media\fp\3d\led v2.png"></img>
              <p> this model of the cover for the rgb led is better as all the long faces of this model are the same, allowing me to have 1 face to 4 sides.</p>
              <p> by then , i finished my cover for the base.</p>
              <img src="..\..\media\fp\3d\v1 w cover.png"></img>
              <p> when i printed the cover and base, i found out that i forgotten to include the securing parts for the lcd and the arduino board.
                on my 2nd printing of the base, i measured the securing points for the lcd wrongly, so i needed to reprint it.
                for my cover, i printed the wrong dimensions for the led cover and  ultrasonic sensor, then adjusted it to be bigger because i forgotten to take into consideration of the wires pushing the layer up.
              </p>
              <img src="..\..\media\fp\3d\v3 wo pink.jpeg"></img>
              <p>printed 2 parts to secure the layer 2, although it was unnecessary after wiring it, since the wires pushed the layer up to tighten it with the model.</p>

              <img src="..\..\media\fp\building\secure2.jpeg" height="300" width="auto"></img>
              <p>laser cut some covers for the devices that are exposed.</p>
              <img src="..\..\media\fp\building\all together now.jpeg" height="300" width="auto"></img>
              <p>the wiring was pretty poorly done, since i didnt think about it and it was too late to redo the design to incoporate the wires.</p>
              <img src="..\..\media\fp\building\BOMB.jpeg" height="300" width="auto"></img>
              <p>
                this is how the final model looks like, cover and base. after printing, it looks like this:

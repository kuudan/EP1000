            <p>General Idea: I would like to make a mood lamp that can display eniviromental readings</p>
            <h5>Specifics:</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>1. It will only react when there is an object within a distance</li>
              <li>2. It will read temperature. If it is too hot, the lamp will turn blue and the display will say that its too hot.</li>
              <li>3. It will read humidity. If it is too humid, the lamp would turn red and ask you to create some ventilation</li>
              <li>4. If there is something too near the lamp, the lamp will turn red and tell you to move away from it.</li>
              <li>5. By default, the lamp will be X(undecided)</li>
              <li>6. If, after a certain period of time, there is no change in response, the lamp will switch its lights off when there is no object in the surroundings/no change in conditions from default (when the light is X, the neutral state for this project)</li>
              <li>7. A button to switch on and off the lights</li>
              <li>8. A potential meter to allow users to adjust conditions in 1., 2., 3.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Who is it intended for:</h5>
              <p>students who use a computer for long periods of time</p>
              <h6>reasons:</h6>
              <ul>
                <li>1. Due to the current pandemic (in 2020), a lot of students have to sit in front of the computer for prolonged periods of time. This lamp will be able to help keep students in check.</li>
                <li>2. When engrossed and/or immersed in their studies, students tend to not take notice of their surroundings -- of which one of them is gluing their eyes to the computer. the lamp will be able to tell the student through the change in color.</li>
                <li>3. Students also tend to play games. Some of these games can overheat the computer. While it is easy to notice how hot the computer has become, sometimes they will ignore it. the lamp can help remind them by telling them that it is too hot.</li>
                <li>4. Comfort is important. Humidity/Temperature affects comfort a lot. The sensors can help inform students that the environment is too humid, which will prompt the to reduce humidty, improving their comfort and hence their ability to learn.</li>
              </ul>
            <h5>Materials needed:</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>1 Push button</li>
                <li>1 small Breadboard</li>
                <li>1 Arduino</li>
                <li>1 LCD display</li>
                <li>1 RGB LED should be needed, i think</li>
                <li>16 male to female wires</li>
                <li>1 potential meter</li>
                <li>1 ultrasonic sensor</li>
                <li>translucent acrylic</li>
              </ul>

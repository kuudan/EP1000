          <p>For the group assignment, I am working together with Caleb Yeow and Quan Yao.</p>
          <a href="https://mtgbootz.github.io/3Dprinting-grp/3Dprinting-group">click here to see our findings.</a>
          <p>For this assignment, I am working on wall thickness.</p>
          <p>I have picked a range of values for thickness, ranging from 0.5mm to 3.0mm, to test the lowest limits and by what thickness I should stop at for small models. This was the original design:</p>
          <img src="..\..\media\grpass\Wall Thickness 2D.png" alt="plan" height="600" width="auto"></img>
          <p>However, halfway through I realized that 3.0mm might be too thick, so I had reduced the maximum thickness to 2.0mm. To ensure sufficient spacing between each wall, I increased the width to 20mm and the length to 30mm </p>
          <p>I have also tested for accuracy of the wall thickness up to 2 decimal points, but I wouldn't know the results until it is printed.</p>
          <img src="..\..\media\grpass\wall thickness top.png" alt="top" height="300" width="auto"></img>
          <p>I have also tried to test for maximum height possible before failure for 1.0mm. However, I hypothesize that I would not be able to test the limits for this part due to dimensional constraints.</p>
          <img src="..\..\media\grpass\wall thickness front.png" alt="front view" height="300" width="auto"></img>
          <p>When I sliced the model, I saw that 0.5mm is still sliceable, so I tried to go for the lowest possible it can go, and found out that it cannot slice at 0.4mm.</p>
          <p>I have also tested the values between  0.4mm to 0.5mm, and 0.41mm is the absolute minimum that we can go before cura is unable to slice it. The final model will have 0.41mm as its minimal wall thickness</p>

          <p> after printing, I found out that the size of the print is too small to see the effects of wall thickness. however, i notice that for a wall height of 10mm, all wall thickness below 1mm are easy to bend, whereas the wall thickness below 2mm for the same height are slightly harder to bend, with 2mm being unbendable. For the wall thickness 1mm at 20mm height is bendable. however, it did not break as I expected.</p>

          <p>wow, you cant see the numbers i wrote on it at all</p>

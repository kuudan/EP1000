          <h2> Section 1: Webpage templates</h2>

          <p>
            We will create a simple website to help understand how html based websites work.
            To note: Text written in "/* [text] */" are for explanation. no need to include it in yours.
          </p>
          <!--Start of example-->
        <xmp>
            <!DOCTYPE html> /* To Declare what kind of page this is */

            <html> /* the start of your page */

            <head> /* to tell the website what appears at the tab */

              <title>Your title</title> /* what shows at your tab's title*/

            </head>

            <style> /*tells you what style the page has*/

              body {background-color: lightgrey;} /*tells website that the background color of website is black*/

              p {color: black;} /*tells website that font color for "p", which is "paragraph", is black.*/

            </style> /* ends the stlying section of the page */

            <body> /*beginning of the main content of the page */

              <h1>Content</h1> /* h means header, goes from 1 to 6, increasing number = smaller font size */

            </body> /* end of main content */

            </html> /* end of page */

          </xmp>
          <p> That will only create a basic layout, however.
              You should use "css" to spice up your webpage.
          </p>
          <p>  You need to name the file which contains what format you want the webpage
              to ".css". Then, you reference it in &#60;Header&#62; as
              "&#60;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="directory to the file"/&#62;".
          </p>
          <p> this is how it works for the ".css": </p>
          <xmp>

            body /* what you want to format */
            {
            	background-color: #000000; /*things you want to change */
            	font-family: Helvitica, Arial, sans-serif;
            }

            table, th, td /*you can format more than one at a time */
            {
              border: 10px solid blue;
            }
            /*opening and closing brackets " { " and " } " */
          </xmp>

          <h3>Section 2: Hosting your own website</h3>
          <p>
            Now that you have made your own website, you can host it on a hosting website!
            I strongly recommend using <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a> to upload your creations.
            You can upload any of your works there, be it a code, a website, or even an app. You can also track your progress, learn from other github
            users and restore from an older version. Create a repository and upload your contents in the repository.
          </p>

          <h3> Section 3: Using github desktop</h3>
          <p>
            I'm sure it's annoying to open <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a> everytime you want to update/upload something from your desktop.
            You can instead use github desktop to get rid of the hassle. With github desktop, once you connect the local repository(i.e. the offline version
            that you edit and have in your desktop) and your account to the app, it will detect any changes and you can then push the updates from the app directly to github.
          </p>

          <h3>Tips:</h3>
          <p>
            You should always keep an easily ascessible template of your website's general layout,
            so that you can save time in creating webpages.
          </p>
          <p> You can go to w3schools and youtube to furthur learn how to add other stuff in, like adding links, audio, images, and interactive content.</p>

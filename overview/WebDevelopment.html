          <h2> Section 1: Webpage templates</h2>

          <p>
            We will create a simple website to help understand how html based websites work.
            To note: Text written in "/* [text] */" are for explanation. no need to include it in yours.
          </p>
          <!--Start of example-->
        <xmp>
            <!DOCTYPE html> /* To Declare what kind of page this is */

            <html> /* the start of your page */

            <head> /* to tell the website what appears at the tab */

              <title>Your title</title> /* what shows at your tab's title*/

            </head>

            <style> /*tells you what style the page has*/

              body {background-color: lightgrey;} /*tells website that the background color of website is black*/

              p {color: black;} /*tells website that font color for "p", which is "paragraph", is black.*/

            </style> /* ends the stlying section of the page */

            <body> /*beginning of the main content of the page */

              <h1>Content</h1> /* h means header, goes from 1 to 6, increasing number = smaller font size */

            </body> /* end of main content */

            </html> /* end of page */
          </xmp>

          <p> That will only create a basic layout, however.
              You should use "css" to spice up your webpage.
          </p>
          <p>  You need to name the file which contains what format you want the webpage
              to ".css". Then, you reference it in &#60;Header&#62; as
              "&#60;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="directory to the file"/&#62;".
          </p>
          <p> this is how it works for the ".css": </p>

          <xmp>
            body /* what you want to format */
            {
            	background-color: #000000; /*things you want to change */
            	font-family: Helvitica, Arial, sans-serif;
            }

            table, th, td /*you can format more than one at a time */
            {
              border: 10px solid blue;
            }
            /*opening and closing brackets " { " and " } " */
          </xmp>

          <h3>Section 2: Useful Attributes</h3>
          <p>We can add images through the use of &#60;img&#62;</p>
          <xmp>
            <img src="z" height="x" width="y" alt="text in case you cannot locate image">
             src = source image, can be a .gif too
             z = where your image file is with respect to the page you are at OR a link
             x = a number or "auto" (auto = auto sizing)
             y = same type of value as x
             alt="" is important to show an alternative
          </xmp>
          <p> for example, this(you can right-click the image and click inspect element to investigate it): </p>
            <img src="..\media\2d\a prayer for chance.png" height="auto" width="500px" alt="praying for a chance"></img>

          <p>another thing you can add is links, through the use of &#60;href&#62;</p>
          <xmp>
            <a href="link">[what the link should say]</a>
            OR
            <a href="link" [target]>
              <img src="images" alt="text" width="value" height="value"></img>
              [target]=how the page will be opened, i.e. new tab, new window, on the same window/tab, etc
              what you can put into [target]: _self , _blank , _parent , _top
          </xmp>
            <p>here is an example:</p>
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" target="_blank">
                <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5f/24/26/5f242686e1b2ca9677023947ce4edd2a.gif" alt="a surprise" width="300px" height="auto"></img>
              </a>

          <h3>Section 3: Hosting your own website</h3>
          <p>
            Now that you have made your own website, you can host it on a hosting website!
            I strongly recommend using <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a> to upload your creations.
            You can upload any of your works there, be it a code, a website, or even an app. You can also track your progress, learn from other github
            users and restore from an older version. Create a repository and upload your contents in the repository.
          </p>

          <h3>Tips:</h3>
          <p>
            You should always keep an easily ascessible template of your website's general layout,
            so that you can save time in creating webpages.
          </p>
          <p> You can go to w3schools and youtube to furthur learn how to add other stuff in, like audio and interactive content.</p>

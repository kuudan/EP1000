            For this assignment, we are to create a 3D model that is difficult to do in conventional methods, utlize the parameter settings, ensure it is within 30mm x 30mm x 30mm and keep it within 30mins print time.</p>
          <p>It took me a few days to figure out what I should make, since there was a lot of choices available.
            What gave me a rough idea of what to make was this image that the teacher showed as an example(might be different, since i took this image off the internet):</p>
            <img src="..\media\ball cube.jpeg" alt="image of ball in cube" height="300" width="auto">
          <p>After that, I thought to myself: "What if I made it such that you could move something in this model, but never be able to take it out no matter how you try?"
          Then I started drawing a simple idea in autocad</p>
          <img src="..\media\assignment1idea.png" alt="drawing of idea" height="300" width="auto">
          <p> I then started making a model in fusion360.</p>

          <p> So firstly, I made a box. Then I shelled it with 2mm wall thickness. Following that, I made a hole on 4 sides, each a different shape. Afterwards, I extruded the shape matching the holes.
            Lastly, I extruded an extension at the back and extruded a smaller cube in the middle to prevent it from being taken out from either side.</p>
          <p>When I sliced the model, I realized I needed support, and the printing time was 48mins, so I scaled it in the Cura app to 20mmx20mmx16.7mm, which reduced the time taken to 20mins.</p>
          <ul>settings used:

            For the group assignment, I am working together with Caleb Yeow and Quan Yao.</p>
            <a href="https://mtgbootz.github.io/3Dprinting-grp/3Dprinting-group">click here to see our findings.</a>
            <p>For this assignment, I am working on wall thickness.</p>
            <p>I have picked a range of values for thickness, ranging from 0.5mm to 3.0mm, to test the lowest limits and by what thickness I should stop at for small models. This was the original design:</p>
            <img src="..\media\Wall Thickness 2D.png" alt="plan" height="300" width="auto">
            <p>However, halfway through I realized that 3.0mm might be too thick, so I had reduced the maximum thickness to 2.0mm. To ensure sufficient spacing between each wall, I increased the width to 20mm and the length to 30mm </p>
            <p>I have also tested for accuracy of the wall thickness up to 2 decimal points, but I wouldn't know the results until it is printed.</p>
            <img src="..\media\wall thickness top.png" alt="top" height="300" width="auto">
            <p>I have also tried to test for maximum height possible before failure for 1.0mm. However, I hypothesize that I would not be able to test the limits for this part due to dimensional constraints.</p>
            <img src="..\media\wall thickness front.png" alt="front view" height="300" width="auto">
            <p>When I sliced the model, I saw that 0.5mm is still sliceable, so I tried to go for the lowest possible it can go, and found out that it cannot slice at 0.4mm.</p>
            <p>I have also tested the values between  0.4mm to 0.5mm, and 0.41mm is the absolute minimum that we can go before cura is unable to slice it. The final model will have 0.41mm as its minimal wall thickness</p>

          <h4>what is embedded programming?</h4>
            <p> it is a mini-computer programmed with dedicated functions to work in a system</p>
          <h4>what arduino is</h4>
            <p>it's a system made of
              <ul>
                <li> 1. Integrated Development System (IDE)</li>
                <li> 2. A programming language that is similar to c++ based on Wiring</li>
                <li> 3. Development & Debugging tool based on Processing</li>
                <li> 4. many open source Software libraries</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
          <h4>an online resource for arduino: tinkercad</h4>
            <p>it's free to use, and saves on resources since you dont have to worry about losing electronics due to wrong wiring/inappropriate usage of electronics</p>
            <p>while it is limited on the number of software libraries you can use, you can still do most of the coding in tinkercad. since my part of my breadboard isnt working, i will be using tinkercad for the time being.</p>
            <h5>how to use tinkercad</h5>
              <p>after making an account on tinkercad, you can use this option (circuit) to start making circuits, then the "create new circuit" to make a new circuit</p>

                <img src="..\media\tinkercad02.png" alt="create new circuit" width="300" height="auto">
                <p>in this interface, "components -> basic" items are the common electronics used, and "components -> all" is all the electronics that can be used in arduino.</p>
                <img src="..\media\tinkercad03.png" alt="interface" width="500" height="auto">
                <p>"starters -> basic" introduces you to simple wiring, and "starters -> arduino" introduces you to simple arduino circuits and programming. try exploring them sometime!</p>
                <img src="..\media\tinkercad04.png" alt="circuit interface" width="600" height="auto">
                <p>"start simulation" allows you to turn on the supply power and interact with the circuit, whereas "code" allows you to make changes to the code</p>
                <img src="..\media\tinkercad05.png" alt="code interface" width="600" height="auto">
                <p>in the code editor, there are 3 options you can view the code in.
                  <ul>
                    <li> blocks, which is easier for those with zero programming experience.</li>
                    <li> blocks+text, which helps people move from blocks to pure text</li>
                    <li> text, which is the main medium we will use for programming</li>
                  </ul>
            <h4>wiring</h4>
              <p>wiring is very important. you can accidentally lose lots of money if you wire them wrongly.</p>
              <img src="..\media\pololu_circuit.png" alt="a simple circuit">
              <p>first: never ever ever connect source to ground (that is, connecting the battery's  + ve and - ve sides directly / without resistors).
                you need a component and a resistor(on the +ve side) to prevent the circuit from short circuiting and catching fire / over heating.</p>
              <p>leds: flat side is -ve side, commonly with a shorter pin (if no one has messed with trimming the pins)</p>
              <p>you should look up on the specifications of the components before you use it to prevent accidentally breaking something</p>
            <h4>programs</h4>
